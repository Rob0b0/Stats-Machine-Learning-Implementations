### Some implementations of statical ML methods I learned in class.  

1. MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition with Gaussian Generative Method. 
2. Extract 10 most relevant features from 100 features using Lasso (Linear Regression) 
3. Perceptron Algorithm and basic SVM to identify binary-class linear decision boundary 
4.
